WP-Notices-Ticker--fork-
========================

A fork of the Notices Ticker plugin for WordPress to add support for categories and links. Now notices in the ticker can be linked to a page on the site and restricted to display only in a certain section of the site, as set by the category.

The original Notices Ticker is at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/notices/ and its Subversion repo is at http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/notices/
